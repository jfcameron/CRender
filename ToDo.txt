Consolidate Android entry and windows entry file. Separate files doesnt make sense!!
Consolidate resource files, textures etc.
Figure out how to load resources from the common directory when running from ide.
Add a SCREEN X,Y and updateScreenSize() to graphics.c
Textures should be read from /Textures not ROOT

Windows: main.c to main.cpp
